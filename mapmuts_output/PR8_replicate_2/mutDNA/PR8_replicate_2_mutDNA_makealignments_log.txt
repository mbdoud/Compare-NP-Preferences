applyfilter = True: all reads flagged Y  by the Illumina filter will be removed.

minq = 25.00: any read pair where the average Q-score of either read is < this will be removed.

upcase = 'test': converting fullgene, a1, and a2 to upper case.
Testing case of first R1 and R2 reads... test passed, first reads upper case.
