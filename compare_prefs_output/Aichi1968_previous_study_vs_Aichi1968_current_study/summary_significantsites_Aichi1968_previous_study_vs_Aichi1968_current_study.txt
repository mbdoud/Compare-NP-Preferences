Tests for clustering of significant sites:
Of the top 0 sites with largest preference shifts (null hypotheses rejected using exact randomization),
0 of these sites are resolved in the crystal structure and tested for spatial clustering here.
the median distance to nearest neighbor among these sites is nan,
the median distance to nearest neighbor among 1000 random draws of 0 sites is nan,
the one-sided Mann-Whitney U Test P-value comparing these distributions is 0.000000

Of the top 14 sites with largest preference shifts (null hypotheses rejected using simulation),
10 of these sites are resolved in the crystal structure and tested for spatial clustering here.
the median distance to nearest neighbor among these sites is 17.103849,
the median distance to nearest neighbor among 1000 random draws of 10 sites is 11.376545,
the one-sided Mann-Whitney U Test P-value comparing these distributions is 0.026821


Test for distance of significant sites to variable sites:
Of the top 0 sites with largest preference shifts (null hypotheses rejected using exact randomization),
0 of these sites are evolutionarily conserved between PR/1934 and Aichi/1968 and are resolved in the crystal structure and tested here.
the median distance to nearest variable site among these sites is nan,
the median distance to nearest variable site among 1000 random draws of 0 sites is nan,
the one-sided Mann-Whitney U Test P-value comparing these distribution is 0.000000

Of the top 14 sites with largest preference shifts (null hypotheses rejected using simulation),
